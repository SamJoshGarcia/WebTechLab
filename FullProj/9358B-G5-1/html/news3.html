		<p class="newsArticle">Eight former wet market vendor inside Barangay Betag filed a case against Michael Guiab,
							   the owner of the area. Alleging they lost their jobs because of their religious beliefs.
							   The heat caused a lawsuit that was filed last week with the help of the Constitution of the Philippines 
							   on behalf of Andrea Cayabyab - one of the dreaded vendors. <p>    

		<p class="newsArticle">The case alleges religious discrimination and violations of the vendors' rights to freely express 
							   their religion.The lawsuit said that some of the vendors prayed in front of a mini crucifix while selling 
							   goods to costumers, where Michael Guiab saw the preaching, as an INC, he was offended by the act of the vendor 
							   and immediately shut her stall down. As his defensive response, he only said that: "They're troublemakers and 
							   fools customer for their own profit." The lawsuit will continue on the first week of march this 2018. 
							   Andrea apologized for her unintentional actions but will still fight for their right as a Roman Catholic.</p>
