		La Trinidad is home to the famous strawberry farm, a large patch of land filled with rows and rows of strawberry plants everywhere. 
		Its calm and peaceful environment attracts many locals and tourists to come and have a pleasant time relishing the sights and picking the strawberries, for a price of course. The people that work here wear the common attire of a farmer which consists of a large hat or a protective cloth and light shirt and pants. Our group came to this place to make inquiries on whether the wage for males and females are identical.
		We approached a female farmer named Rose and asked if the wages of both genders are equal and she answered that most of the farmers working at strawberry farm are women so there may be a different wage for male and female farmers. We thanked her for her time and we continued on to look for a male farmer to see things in his perspective.

		Not long after, we found a Nestor, man laboring nearby, and we came toward him to make the same inquiry and he confirmed that the wages of a male and female farmer are definitely disproportionate. He said that the wage of a male farmer is actually less than a female farmer. Nestor isn't bothered much with the wage disparity saying that this how the situation is and he just simply accepts it.
		We also thanked him for his time and finally left the farm with this newfound knowledge.
