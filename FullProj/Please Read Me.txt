	Good day Sir, we just want to inform you that our group will have a common image
folder for both the altstyle and style instead of having image folders inside each style folder.
Our reason is that we plan to use the same images but apply different styles. Also, we found it
a bit problematic in our part to refer to specific images especially that we must put images on 
specific folders when we'll only be using the same images. We hope that you'll understand our
reasons. Thank you for the consideration and God bless po sir.

PS - We renamed our style.css in the style folder into altstyle.css so that upon viewing the index.html,
     you can already see the fun style of the website without altering the names of the styles. Above that,
     we have changed nothing from the first style.css aka the professional theme. The names of each css can be
     interchanged in order to either change the theme from professional to fun and vice-versa.
